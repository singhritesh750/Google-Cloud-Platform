click to Activate google cloud shell on top right corner
click to "Continue"
Then apears the Shell Terminal with "Welcome to Cloud Shell!" message.

There is 2 information given on this page:
(a) the project id i.e., IT AUTOMATICALLY CONNECTS TO YOUR CURRENT PROJECT
(b) the "gcloud config set project [PROJECT_ID]" to change to a different project

GITHUB CMD COMMANDS:
1.	echo "# Google-Cloud-Platform" >> README.md
2.	git init
3.	git add README.md
4.	git commit -m "first commit"
5.	git branch -M main
6.	git remote add origin https://github.com/singhritesh750/Google-Cloud-Platform.git
7.	git push -u origin main

Back to GCS terminal->
"gcloud help" to get hep
"gcloud version" to get version
Afterall its a normal linux machine so all the commands working there will also work here as well
"pwd" -> check the present directory 
ls -l -> to check the directory
cat R[tab button] -> to read the file inside the directory
 
** [first name of the file ][tab button] -> Auto completes the name of the file that FIRST APPEARS WITH THE ALPHABET
 
* Few informations to notice in the above command return:
 (a) VM is ephemeral -> it is temporary so anything that you want to be saved, should be saved
 (b) home directory will persist accross sessions -> so everything should be saved here
 (c) "dl [file_name]" -> to download the file
 
 
NOW, steps to starting working with the git file:
"git clone [full_https_link]" -> to get the lab files from the git
"ls -l" -> SEE IT CREATES A NEW DIRECTORY FOR US
"cd gcp-cloud-engineer["/" -> optional]" -> Let's navigate into that directory.
"cd Cloud-shell-Hello["/" -> optional]" -> Now inside there there's another folder.


* This directory has a couple of source files for no JSA applications.
  "node Hello.js" -> runnig it tells us that it's running an application on its local hosts address on Port 8080

** BUT if we try navigating to that address from browser then we'll see that it doesn't work because the local host for this browser is different than one for CS(Web Preview)

"Web preview" -> URL to connect us through to the application


Now, Important point to focus:
we get an "appspot.com" URL to connect us through to the application that we're running in CS.
IT'S Registrant Organization: Google LLC
AppSpot is an app launcher.


"node [file_name.js]" -> to run the file
Can edit the content on the .js file either
 (1) in shell or
 (2) on the cloud editor.
"ctrl+c" -> to stop the server running for the port 8080 by "node [file_name.js]"
"nodemon [file_name.js]" -> to run and load the changes in the source file into the node. it's a tool that comes pre-installed in the CS.


Now, to update the Lab-file from the terminal using commands
(1). git clone https://github.com/ACloudGuru/gcp-cloud-engineer.git
(2). ls -l
(3). cd gcp-cloud-engineer/
(4). ls -l
(5). (a) If update.sh is executable i.e., green in color, then -> cd update.sh
     (b) if not then first make it executable -> chmod +x upudate.sh
                                              -> cd update.sh
Once above steps are done then from now on, just run the update script -> cd update.sh


Using GC Storage:
(1). first make the Bucket from the console with globally unique name
(2). thne open the bucket and upload some files into it
Clicking the files open them. URL of these files are long because they are signed and BY DEFAULT PRIVATELY ACCESSIBLE
to make it publicly accessible : (1). far right corner click 3 dots
                                  (2). open permissions then add user name it alluser and make it reader
                                  

GC storage store all sorts of objects but inside of a bucket (container). The location of a bucket cannot be changed after the bucket has been created

Name for bucket MUST BE unique across cloud storage i.e., just like Project I.D. bucket names are globally unique. Now, The URL request for every file inside the bucket, to open, is very long because it's a signed request to be able to view this file. Every file is private. Not just anyone is allowed to view this file by default.
"URL can end with either object or can be file".
It does not have a hierarchical file system. Hierarchy can be created here if you want to, by giving each object a name that includes "/". And if you do that it'll act like folders.
Every object whose name ends with a "/" is considered to be a folder and you can navigate into that folder and upload files there if you want.

gsutil equivalent for rename files in bucket -> gsutil mv -p gs:// storage-lab-console/test/[file_name] git

Using "gsutil"- (Previously using the console web app)
To verify that we're in the right project & account- gcloud config list

gsutil - a command-line tool to connect to GC storage and it mimics many of the commands in a normal shell prompt. e.g., if we type gsutil ls it shows us the buckets.

Note:
the native GC storage addresses (bucket name) starts with gs:// similar to how Web addresses start with HTTP://

gsutil ls gs://[bucket_name]/ -> to show the content of bucket (shows folder but not it's content)
gsutil ls gs://[bucket_name]/** -> to list everything as a completely flat list (shows folder + it's content)
gs mb --help -> this can give you a few pages of good information on how to make a bucket
gsutil mb -l northamerica-northeast1 ["using gs://" bucket name] -> creates the bucket

gcloud config list : shows which account is currently used and what is the current project.

gsutil -> Is the command-line tool that can be used to connect to GC storage. It mimics many of the commands that are in the normal shell prompt.
gsutil ls -> shows us the buckets present.

NOTE: similar to how Web addresses start with https:// NATIVE GC STORAGE ADDRESSES STARTS WITH gs:// .

gsutil ls gs://[tab button]/ -> auto-complete the rest of the bucket name. hit enter to see the objects that are uploaded in the console lab.

NOTE: this actually shows the test folder and not the contents of the folder.

gsutil ls gs://[tab button]/** -> to list everything.
gsutil label get [gs://bucket_name]/ ->  reult is json document listing the labels of bucket.
gsutil label get [gs://bucket_name]/ > [new_filename.json]

">" symbol - run the thing before it and to put the output into the file with the name that comes after it.

cat new_filename.json -> result is same json labels
gsutil label get [gs://new_bucket_name]/ -> result is no label
gsutil label set [new_filename.json] [gs://new_bucket_name]
